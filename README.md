# Introduction
Welcome to my Portfolio! This repository showcases a selection of my data science/analytics projects, demonstrating my skills and competencies in the field. Each directory within this repository contains a distinct project I've worked on. 

For example, the **NLP-Contextual-Analysis** directory houses an NLP project focused on contextual analysis.

## Purpose
This portfolio serves to highlight my expertise and provide potential collaborators, employers, and fellow data enthusiasts with insight into my work.

## Navigation
**Project Directories**: Each directory is named after the project it contains.
**README Files**: Inside each project directory, you'll find a README file with detailed information about the project.

## Dependencies

### Global Requirements
- Python 3.12.5

### Project-Specific Dependencies
Each project in this repository may have its own set of dependencies. For detailed information:

1. Navigate to the specific project directory.
2. Refer to the `README.md` file within that directory for project-specific dependencies.
3. If present, check the `requirements.txt` file for a complete list of Python packages required.

### Setting Up
To set up the environment for a specific project:

1. Ensure Python 3.12.3 is installed on your system.
2. Install the project specific dependancies. If a `requirements.txt` file is present in the project directory, run:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
Otherwise, use the `README.md` file to get more information about the project.

Note: If you encounter any issues with dependencies or setup, or you notice issues with the code, please refer to the individual project's README. If that doesn't help then open an issue in this repository.
